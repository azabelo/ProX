Runtime per-expert -> stacked converter for transformers v4 Qwen3-Omni-MoE.

The converter is registered on three classes that can each be the load entry,
and they expose different parameter prefixes:

    Qwen3OmniMoeForConditionalGeneration          → ``thinker.model.layers.*``
    Qwen3OmniMoeThinkerForConditionalGeneration   → ``model.layers.*``
    Qwen3OmniMoeThinkerTextModel                  → ``layers.*``

We pick the pattern at factory time from config introspection so each load
target only matches its own keys. The top-level pattern intentionally excludes
the talker tower: in v4 the talker keeps ``nn.ModuleList`` experts and consumes
HF per-expert keys natively, so passing them through unchanged is required.

After the OpSlot migration, the thinker uses stacked-parameter storage in
both eager and fused modes (the eager path runs the standard expert loop
over the stacked tensors via ``F.linear``), so the converter always fires
for thinker keys regardless of the runtime ``ops_implementation.moe_implementation``
selection.
